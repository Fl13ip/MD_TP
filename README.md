# Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering - Modeling and Design - Practical Work

## Objective
The practical work involves analyzing and designing an information system. It consists of three phases:

1. Vision and scope: System scope, Use Case specification, Use Case Diagram, Supplementary Requirement Specification.
2. Problem analysis: Complete Use Case specification, Activity Diagram, Domain Model, Glossary.
3. Solution design: System Sequence Diagram, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram.

The solution should represent a realistic scenario within the given context. Additional coherent and original functionalities are encouraged.

## Health System
A new system is required to manage user information in the national health service. It should enable:
- Appointment and exam scheduling.
- Reporting of exam results.
- Access to patient records for healthcare providers.
- Prescription management for doctors.
- Vaccine administration and measurements for nurses.
- Lab test result recording.
- Employee records management for human resources.
- User registration and verification.

The system should support various functionalities, such as viewing appointments, medical records, prescriptions, and vaccination history. Diabetic users can also track their blood glucose measurements.

Prescriptions can be dispensed by pharmacists, and administrative staff can issue attendance certificates and handle billing.

The system uses an internal database to store information.
